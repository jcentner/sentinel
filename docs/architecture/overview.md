**Pipeline order:** Detectors (phase 1: deterministic + heuristic) → Risk signals → Detectors (phase 2: LLM-assisted) → Fingerprint → Dedup → Embed Index (opt-in) → Context → Judge → Synthesis (standard+) → Persistence → Store → Report. Two-phase execution (TD-043) lets heuristic detectors inform LLM targeting — high-churn files get priority analysis. Dedup runs *before* context gathering and judging to avoid wasting effort on suppressed or duplicate findings.

## Component responsibilities

### 1. Detectors

Detectors produce raw candidate findings. They come in three tiers:

**Tier 1 — Deterministic**: Lint output (ruff for Python, ESLint/Biome for JS/TS), TODO/FIXME scanning, dependency audit (pip-audit). Cheap, reliable, no model needed.

**Tier 2 — Heuristic**: Git-history hotspots (commit frequency analysis), cyclomatic complexity / function length analysis. Also model-free.

**Tier 3 — LLM-assisted**: Docs-drift doc-code comparison, semantic docs-drift section-vs-code comparison, test-code coherence analysis, inline comment drift (docstring vs code), and intent comparison (multi-artifact triangulation) via the configured model provider (default: Ollama). The semantic-drift detector compares documentation sections against the source code they reference. The test-coherence detector pairs test functions with their implementation functions. The intent-comparison detector gathers code, docstring, tests, and doc sections for each function and identifies contradictions between any pair. All produce binary "needs review" / "in sync" signals.

The architecture is **a mix of Tier 1+2 deterministic/heuristic detectors and Tier 3 LLM-assisted cross-artifact analysis**. Four LLM detectors (semantic-drift, test-coherence, inline-comment-drift, intent-comparison) represent the project's core differentiator.

Every detector produces a `Finding` conforming to the [Detector Interface](detector-interface.md).

**Implemented detectors**: `todo-scanner` (T1), `lint-runner` (T1), `eslint-runner` (T1), `go-linter` (T1), `rust-clippy` (T1), `dep-audit` (T1), `docs-drift` (T1+T3), `stale-env` (T1), `unused-deps` (T1), `cicd-drift` (T1), `architecture-drift` (T1), `git-hotspots` (T2), `complexity` (T2), `dead-code` (T2), `semantic-drift` (T3), `test-coherence` (T3), `inline-comment-drift` (T3), `intent-comparison` (T3).

**Value assessment**: Based on real-world validation, the highest-value shipped detectors are docs-drift (97% accuracy catching broken links and stale paths), semantic-drift (LLM-powered prose-vs-code comparison), and test-coherence (LLM-powered test staleness detection). Lint/complexity/todo detectors largely duplicate existing dev tooling. The highest-leverage planned extensions are detectors that leverage more powerful models for structured analysis. Prompt strategy (binary vs enhanced) is benchmark-driven — the system checks per-model×detector quality data, falling back to the `model_capability` config hint for untested models. See [ADR-016](decisions/016-benchmark-driven-model-quality.md).

### 2. Fingerprint Assignment

Each finding receives a content-based fingerprint (SHA-256 of `detector:category:file_path:normalized_content`, truncated to 16 hex chars). Normalization is detector-specific to ensure stability across trivial changes like whitespace or line-number shifts.

### 3. Deduplicator

Compares fingerprints against the state store to:
- Skip previously suppressed findings
- Skip duplicates within the same run
- Mark recurring findings (found in prior runs) for higher visibility

### 4. Context Gatherer

For each candidate finding, retrieves supporting context using two strategies:

**Heuristic context** (always active):
- Surrounding code lines (±5 lines around the affected location)
- Related test files (convention-based matching: `test_<module>.py`)
- Recent git log for the affected file

**Embedding-based semantic context** (opt-in via `embed_model` config):
- Repo files are chunked (50-line windows with 10-line overlap) and embedded via `provider.embed()`
- Embeddings stored as float32 BLOBs in the SQLite `chunks` table
- For each finding, the title + description are embedded and compared against all chunks via cosine similarity
- Top-5 most relevant chunks (above similarity threshold 0.3) added as additional evidence
- Incremental indexing: only re-embeds files whose content has changed
- Falls back gracefully to heuristic-only if embeddings are unavailable

See ADR-009 for full architecture decisions.

### 5. LLM Judge

A model (via the configured provider — default: Ollama) that receives each finding + its gathered context and answers:
- Is this likely real?
- What evidence supports it?
- How severe is it?

This is a structured judgment task, not open-ended generation. The model doesn't invent findings — it evaluates candidates produced by deterministic/heuristic detectors. The judge is optional and can be skipped with `--skip-judge`.

All LLM interaction goes through a **`ModelProvider` protocol** (see [ADR-010](decisions/010-pluggable-model-provider.md)). The default provider is Ollama (local). Users can configure any OpenAI-compatible provider (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, vLLM, LM Studio) via `sentinel.toml`. The judge and all LLM-assisted detectors call `provider.generate()` rather than making raw HTTP requests to a specific backend.

**Second role — Analyst** (shipped): For cross-artifact detectors, the LLM also serves as the primary signal source. The semantic-drift detector receives a doc section + the code it describes and produces a binary triage signal: "in sync" or "needs review". The test-coherence detector receives a test function + the implementation it tests and produces a binary signal: "coherent" or "needs review". Even without detailed explanations, these binary signals are the core product value. More powerful models (via cloud providers or larger local GPUs) can deliver structured analysis — explaining *what* is wrong, not just *that* something is wrong — through benchmark-driven prompt adaptation (ADR-016).

### 6. Persistence Tracker

Updates per-fingerprint occurrence counts. Findings seen across multiple runs get `occurrence_count` and `recurring` annotations, enabling the report to show recurrence badges (♻️ ×N) and new-vs-recurring breakdowns.

### 7. State Store (SQLite)

Persistent state across runs. Tracks:
- Previous findings (fingerprinted for dedup)
- Suppression flags (user-marked false positives)
- Run history (when, what scope, how many findings, commit SHA)
- Finding lifecycle (new → confirmed → approved → suppressed → resolved)
- Finding persistence (occurrence counts across runs)
- LLM interaction log (prompts, responses, tokens, timing, verdicts for every LLM call)

Schema version is tracked with an ordered migration framework. Current schema: v7.

This is a Phase 1 design decision, not a later addition. Deduplication is a trust feature.

### 8. Morning Report

Primary output. Markdown formatted, designed to be scannable in under 2 minutes:
- One line per finding with severity, confidence, category
- Findings grouped by severity → category
- Related findings clustered in two passes: first by root-cause pattern (same detector + normalized title), then by directory (3+ findings collapse into `<details>` blocks)
- Expandable evidence sections
- Judge summary and verdict badges (♻️ recurring, ⚠️ FP?)
- Clear approve/suppress actions per finding with fingerprint IDs
- Summary statistics (severity counts, new vs recurring, per-detector breakdown)
- LOW findings truncated at 20 to prevent report bloat

### 9. GitHub Issue Creator

Takes approved findings and creates GitHub issues. Only runs after explicit human approval via `sentinel create-issues`. Deduplicates against existing open issues using fingerprint markers in issue bodies. Supports dry-run mode.

### 9b. Finding Cluster Synthesis

Post-judge pipeline step (Phase 9). Groups related findings by pattern (same detector + normalized title) and sends each cluster to the LLM for root-cause analysis. The LLM identifies shared root causes, flags redundant findings, and suggests a single action that addresses the group.

Gated on `model_capability >= standard`. Graceful degradation: skipped entirely when the model tier is below standard or no provider is available. Annotates findings with `synthesis` context containing root cause, recommended action, cluster label, and redundancy flag. The report shows 🔄 redundant badges and root cause + recommended action in evidence blocks.

Implemented in `src/sentinel/core/synthesis.py`.

### 10. Web UI

Optional browser-based review and management interface (`sentinel serve <repo>`). Starlette + Jinja2 with htmx for progressive enhancement. "Night Watch" design system — dark-first with warm amber accent, Bricolage Grotesque + JetBrains Mono typography, with a light mode toggle. No JavaScript build step.

**Pages and routes:**

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| `/` | Redirect to latest run, or empty state |
| `/runs` | Run history table with scope badges |
| `/runs/{id}` | Run detail: severity stat cards, filters, findings by severity group |

- Reads the same SQLite database — CLI and web share a single source of truth

## What runs where

| Component | Runs on | Resource profile |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Detectors | CPU | Lightweight — linters, grep, subprocess |
| Context Gatherer | CPU + GPU (optional) | File reads, git log commands, `provider.embed()` (when embeddings enabled) |
| LLM Judge | GPU or cloud API | Local: Qwen3.5 4B Q4_K_M via Ollama (~2.8 GB). Cloud: any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. |
| State Store | Disk | SQLite, negligible |
| Report | CPU | Markdown generation |

All model interaction goes through the `ModelProvider` protocol ([ADR-010](decisions/010-pluggable-model-provider.md)). Embeddings use `provider.embed()`. Reranker models are not yet implemented.

## Trigger modes

- **Manual**: On-demand CLI invocation (`sentinel scan <repo>`) — the primary trigger mode.
- **Multi-repo**: `sentinel scan-all REPO1 REPO2 ...` scans multiple repositories into a shared database in one invocation.
- **Web UI**: Configurable scan form in `sentinel serve` web interface — supports repo path override, model selection, skip-judge, and incremental mode.
- **Cron / systemd timer**: Users can schedule overnight runs using their system's cron or systemd timer. See the README for setup instructions. Sentinel itself does not include a built-in scheduler.
- **Git hook**: On last push of the day or on specific events (not implemented — potential future addition).
- **Watch**: File-system watcher for continuous development (not implemented — future).

## Setup and diagnostics

- **`sentinel init <repo>`**: Scaffolds a `sentinel.toml` with documented defaults, creates `.sentinel/` directory, and adds it to `.gitignore`.
- **`sentinel doctor`**: Checks availability of external tools (git, ruff, pip-audit, eslint, biome, golangci-lint, cargo clippy, ollama) and optional Python packages. Supports `--json-output` for machine-readable output.

## Scope per run

- **Full**: Entire repository (default). Runs all detectors on all files.
- **Incremental**: Changed files since last completed run. Enabled via `--incremental` CLI flag.
- **Targeted**: Specific paths or detector categories (available in runner API via `target_paths` parameter; CLI `--target` flag available).

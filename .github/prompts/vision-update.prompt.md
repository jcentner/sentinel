# Vision Update

You are updating the Sentinel vision lock to align with reality. The vision lock is the single source of truth for what the project is, what it isn't, what exists, and where it's going.

Read the current state:

- [Vision lock](../../docs/vision/VISION-LOCK.md)
- [Current state checkpoint](../../roadmap/CURRENT-STATE.md)
- [Project instructions](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [Open questions](../../docs/reference/open-questions.md)
- [Tech debt](../../docs/reference/tech-debt.md)
- [ADR index](../../docs/architecture/decisions/README.md)

## Task

Update `docs/vision/VISION-LOCK.md` to reflect reality. Optionally narrow the scope to: **${input:focusArea}**

## Rules

### What belongs in the vision lock
- Problem statement, target user, core concept
- Explicit non-goals and out-of-scope items
- Product and technical constraints
- Success criteria with current status
- Architecture invariants
- "What Exists Today" — a grounded summary of shipped capabilities
- "Where We're Going" — priority-ordered future directions
- Risks with current assessment
- Changelog at the bottom

### What does NOT belong in the vision lock
- Route inventories, API details, CSS descriptions, schema versions
- Implementation details (those belong in architecture docs, README, or code)
- Session-by-session release notes (those belong in CURRENT-STATE.md)
- Speculative features that haven't been discussed or planned

### Level of abstraction
The vision is a strategic document. It should be readable by someone unfamiliar with the codebase and give them a clear picture of what the project is, what it can do, what it can't, and where it's headed. A capability like "web UI with bulk triage" belongs. A detail like "12 htmx routes with toast notifications" does not.

### Evidence standard
- Every claim in "What Exists Today" must be verifiable by running the code or tests
- Every item in "Where We're Going" must connect to a real user need or documented gap
- Success criteria must show honest current status, including failures

### Change protocol
- Updates are made in-place to the single VISION-LOCK.md file
- Every substantive change gets a brief changelog entry at the bottom
- The version number increments (v2.0 → v2.1 for minor, v3.0 for major scope changes)
- Archival of old versions is not required (git history serves as the audit trail)

## Steps

1. **Assess current reality**: Read the checkpoint file and run `pytest --tb=no -q` to verify test count. Skim the README for shipped feature descriptions.
2. **Compare to vision**: For each section of the vision lock, check whether the claims match reality. Flag any drift.
3. **Update "What Exists Today"**: Match shipped state — detectors, CLI commands, web UI capabilities, test count, eval results.
4. **Update "Where We're Going"**: Add new directions, remove completed ones, re-prioritize based on current context.
5. **Update success criteria status**: Honest assessment of met/unmet/partially met.
6. **Update risks**: Remove mitigated risks, add new ones discovered through implementation.
7. **Write changelog entry**: Summarize what changed and why.
8. **Verify no implementation detail leaked in**: Re-read the final version and strip anything that belongs in architecture docs or README instead.

## Output

Updated `docs/vision/VISION-LOCK.md` with a changelog entry. If significant scope changed, explain the rationale in the chat.

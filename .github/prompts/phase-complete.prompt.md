# Phase Complete

You are completing a development phase for Local Repo Sentinel. Read the project context:

- [Project instructions](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [ADR index](../../docs/architecture/decisions/README.md)
- [Open questions](../../docs/reference/open-questions.md)
- [Tech debt tracker](../../docs/reference/tech-debt.md)
- [Glossary](../../docs/reference/glossary.md)

## Task

Complete the phase documented at: **${input:phasePlanPath}**

## Checklist

Work through each step:

### 1. Verify Acceptance Criteria
- Read the phase plan's acceptance criteria
- Verify each one is met
- Note any criteria that were descoped or changed

### 2. Update Phase Plan Status
- Change status from "In Progress" to "Complete"
- Note any deviations from the original plan
- Record completion date

### 3. Record ADRs
- Were any significant design decisions made during this phase?
- Create ADRs in `docs/architecture/decisions/` for each
- Update the ADR index

### 4. Resolve Open Questions
- Were any open questions from `docs/reference/open-questions.md` answered?
- Update their status to "Resolved" with the resolution
- Were new open questions discovered? Add them

### 5. Record Tech Debt
- Were any shortcuts or compromises made?
- Add them to `docs/reference/tech-debt.md`

### 6. Update Glossary
- Were new terms introduced? Add to `docs/reference/glossary.md`

### 7. Check Docs Consistency
- Do all docs still accurately reflect the codebase after this phase?
- Specifically check: README, architecture overview, detector interface
- Fix any docs-drift introduced during implementation

### 8. Vision Lock Updates
- Did any learnings during this phase affect the vision goals, constraints, or priorities?
- If within-scope (new constraint, priority shift, scope clarification) — update the vision lock in place, increment minor version, append changelog entry
- If scope/goal changes are needed — propose them in `roadmap/CURRENT-STATE.md` under `## Proposed Vision Updates` (do NOT edit the vision lock for these)

### 9. Record Lessons Learned
- What went well?
- What was harder than expected?
- What would we do differently next time?
- Add a "Lessons Learned" section to the phase plan

### 10. Update Roadmap
- Update `roadmap/README.md` to reflect the completed phase
- Note any scope changes that affect future phases

## Output

Present a summary:
- Phase completion status
- ADRs created
- Open questions resolved/added
- Tech debt recorded
- Docs updated
- Lessons learned

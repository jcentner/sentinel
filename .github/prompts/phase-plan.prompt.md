# Phase Plan

You are planning a new development phase for Local Repo Sentinel. Read the project context:

- [Project instructions](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [Architecture overview](../../docs/architecture/overview.md)
- [Detector interface](../../docs/architecture/detector-interface.md)
- [Open questions](../../docs/reference/open-questions.md)
- [Roadmap](../../roadmap/README.md)

## Task

Create a phase planning document for: **${input:phaseDescription}**

## Steps

1. **Understand scope**: Read the roadmap and existing phase docs to understand where this phase fits.
2. **Check open questions**: Review `docs/reference/open-questions.md` for any questions relevant to this phase. Flag ones that must be resolved before implementation.
3. **Check ADRs**: Review `docs/architecture/decisions/` for relevant decisions already made.
4. **Draft the phase plan** with these sections:

### Phase Plan Template

```markdown
# Phase N: [Title]

## Status: Planning

## Goal
One-paragraph description of what this phase accomplishes.

## Features
- [ ] Feature 1: Description
- [ ] Feature 2: Description

## Dependencies
- External tools/libraries needed
- Previous phases that must be complete

## Open Questions (must resolve before implementation)
- OQ-NNN: [question] — needs resolution because [reason]
- New questions discovered during planning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Out of Scope
- What this phase explicitly does NOT include

## Risks
- Risk 1: [description] — mitigation: [approach]
```

5. **Save** the phase plan to `roadmap/phases/phase-N-kebab-title.md`
6. **Update** `roadmap/README.md` to reference the new phase

## Important

- Do not make implementation decisions in the phase plan — that's for `/implementation-plan`.
- Flag any open questions that need resolution. Add new ones to `docs/reference/open-questions.md`.
- If this phase requires a new ADR, note it but don't write it yet.

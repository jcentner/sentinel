# Sentinel — Prompt & Agent Guide

## Primary Workflow: Autonomous Builder

The **autonomous-builder** agent is the primary development workflow. Select it in the Chat agent picker or run it as a Copilot CLI session.

```
VS Code Chat → Agent picker → autonomous-builder → describe your goal
```

Or with Copilot CLI (background, worktree-isolated):

```
VS Code Chat → Session Target → Copilot CLI → select autonomous-builder agent → describe your goal
```

The builder reads `roadmap/CURRENT-STATE.md`, picks up where it left off, and runs a continuous loop: plan → implement → test → review → commit → checkpoint. It uses subagents for research (planner), testing (tester), and review (reviewer).

### Autopilot settings

For fully autonomous sessions, enable these VS Code settings:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `chat.autopilot.enabled` | `true` | Auto-approve + auto-respond |
| `chat.agent.sandbox` | `true` | Restrict writes to workspace |
| `chat.useCustomAgentHooks` | `true` | Enable Stop hook (prevents premature stopping) |

## Manual Override Prompts

These prompts are available for human-driven sessions when you want direct control over a specific step. Type `/` in Chat to invoke them.

| Prompt | What It Does | When to Use |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `/vision-expand` | Interactive brainstorm for what's next after current vision is fulfilled | Vision complete, planning next directions |
| `/phase-plan` | Create a phase planning doc with features, dependencies, acceptance criteria | Starting a new phase manually |
| `/implementation-plan` | Create a file-by-file implementation checklist from a phase doc | Detailed planning before coding |
| `/implementation-plan-review` | Critically analyze the implementation plan for gaps, inefficiencies, problems | After implementation plan is drafted |
| `/implement` | Execute an implementation plan step-by-step | Implementing from an approved plan |
| `/code-review` | Review code for quality, architecture, and security | After changes, before merging |
| `/security-audit` | Security audit across the codebase | After major changes or periodically |
| `/phase-complete` | Update docs, record ADRs and lessons, mark phase done | Wrapping up a phase |
| `/vision-update` | Review and update the vision lock to reflect shipped reality | After completing a phase or shifting direction |

## Custom Agents

| Agent | Role | Tools | Used As |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| `autonomous-builder` | Continuous build loop | All tools + Stop hook | Primary agent |
| `planner` | Research and analysis | Read-only (search, web, codebase) | Subagent of builder |
| `reviewer` | Code review + security | Read-only + terminal output | Subagent of builder |
| `tester` | Write tests from specs | All tools (hidden from picker) | Subagent of builder |

### Catalog Agents (activated on demand)

These agents live in `.github/catalog/agents/` and are activated by the builder when project characteristics match their trigger conditions. See `.github/catalog/MANIFEST.md` for triggers and details.

| Agent | Role | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| `designer` | Visual design system via DESIGN.md | Project has frontend/UI code |
| `product-owner` | User stories + acceptance criteria | Phase planning with missing user stories |
| `security-reviewer` | OWASP, secrets, auth/authz audit | Project handles auth, payments, or PII |
| `critic` | Challenges plans before coding | Phase has 5+ slices |

Agents support **handoffs** — the planner has a button to hand off to implementation, the reviewer has a button to hand off to fix issues.

## How Prompts & Agents Work

- **Prompt files** (`.prompt.md`) — invoked via `/` commands in Chat. Task-specific, human-triggered.
- **Custom agents** (`.agent.md`) — persistent personas with tool restrictions and handoffs. Selected in agent picker.
- **Instruction files** (`.instructions.md`) — applied automatically when Copilot works on matching files.
- **Hooks** (`.github/hooks/`) — deterministic shell commands at agent lifecycle points (e.g., Stop hook blocks premature stopping).
- **Skills** (`.github/skills/`) — technology-specific knowledge that Copilot auto-loads when relevant.
- **Workflow catalog** (`.github/catalog/`) — dormant agents, skills, hooks, and patterns that the builder activates when project characteristics match trigger conditions. See `MANIFEST.md` for the full index.
- **AGENTS.md** — cross-agent instructions recognized by Copilot, Claude Code, and other AI agents.
- Markdown links in prompt/agent bodies **auto-attach referenced files as context**.
- Prompts link to `copilot-instructions.md` for shared project context.

## Design Principles

Based on [VS Code prompt file best practices](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/prompt-files):

1. **No restrictive `tools` list** — The agent inherits all default tools. Only add `tools` to restrict.
2. **Markdown links for context** — Referenced files are attached automatically.
3. **Discovery-first** — Prompts discover relevant code dynamically rather than hardcoding paths.
4. **Input variables** — Use `${input:variable}` for run-time parameters.
5. **Descriptions in frontmatter** — Each prompt has a `description` for autocomplete.
6. **No duplicated instructions** — Prompts link to `copilot-instructions.md` for shared context.
7. **Doc verification before fixes** — Prompts cite authoritative docs before proposing changes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Prompt doesn't appear in `/` menu?** — Check file is in `.github/prompts/` with `.prompt.md` extension.
- **Agent can't find files?** — Don't add a `tools` field unless restricting. Default agent has full access.
- **Stop hook not firing?** — Enable `chat.useCustomAgentHooks: true` in VS Code settings.
- **Agent stops prematurely?** — The Stop hook should block this. Check that `slice-gate.py` exists and is executable.
- **Prompt not picking up context?** — Verify Markdown links use correct relative paths from the prompt file's location.
- **Diagnostics** — Right-click in Chat view → Diagnostics to see all loaded prompts and errors.

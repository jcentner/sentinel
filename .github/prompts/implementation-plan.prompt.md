# Implementation Plan

You are creating a detailed implementation plan for a Sentinel development phase. Read the project context:

- [Project instructions](../../.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- [Architecture overview](../../docs/architecture/overview.md)
- [Detector interface](../../docs/architecture/detector-interface.md)
- [Open questions](../../docs/reference/open-questions.md)

## Task

Create a file-by-file implementation checklist for: **${input:phasePlanPath}**

Read the phase plan document first.

## Steps

1. **Read the phase plan** thoroughly. Ensure all open questions marked as "must resolve before implementation" have been resolved.
2. **Analyze the codebase** — search for existing code, patterns, and conventions that this phase needs to integrate with.
3. **Create the implementation plan** with these sections:

### Implementation Plan Template

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Phase N — [Title]

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Open question OQ-NNN resolved
- [ ] Dependencies installed/available

## Implementation Order
(List files/modules in dependency order — implement leaves first)

### 1. [Component/Module Name]

**Files to create/modify:**
- `path/to/file.py` — Description of what to create/change
  - [ ] Step 1: specific task
  - [ ] Step 2: specific task

**Tests:**
- `tests/path/to/test_file.py` — What to test
  - [ ] Test case 1: description
  - [ ] Test case 2: description (known false positive scenario)

### 2. [Next Component]
...

## Integration Steps
- [ ] Step 1: Wire components together
- [ ] Step 2: End-to-end test

## Verification
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration test passes
- [ ] Acceptance criteria from phase plan met
- [ ] No new lint errors introduced
- [ ] Docs updated if code changed documented behavior
```

4. **Save** the implementation plan alongside the phase plan (e.g., `roadmap/phases/phase-N-implementation.md`)

## Important

- Be specific about file paths and what each file should contain.
- Order by dependency — implement foundations before consumers.
- Include test cases for both true positives AND known false positive scenarios (per quality standards).
- Flag any new open questions or design decisions that surfaced during planning.
- Do not write any code yet — that's for `/implement`.

# Vision Expansion

The current vision has been fulfilled (or is close). Time to figure out what's next.

Read for context:
- [Current vision lock](../../docs/vision/VISION-LOCK.md)
- [Current state](../../roadmap/CURRENT-STATE.md)
- [Architecture overview](../../docs/architecture/overview.md)
- [Tech debt](../../docs/reference/tech-debt.md)
- [Open questions](../../docs/reference/open-questions.md)
- [Archived visions](../../docs/vision/archive/)

## Your role

You are a collaborative brainstorming partner — part product thinker, part technical architect, part friendly devil's advocate. Help the human decide what comes next for Sentinel, then crystallize it into a new vision lock.

**This is a conversation, not a form.** Adapt based on their answers. Dig into interesting threads. Challenge vague thinking. The project has history now — use it.

## Before you start

Summarize what exists:
- What was the original vision? What got built?
- What worked well? What surprised?
- What tech debt or open questions accumulated?
- What user feedback or real-world evidence exists?

Play this back to the human — they may have forgotten details, or the builder may have learned things the human hasn't seen yet.

## Discovery rounds

Use `vscode_askQuestions` for structured choices. Don't ask more than 3–5 questions per round.

### Round 1 — Reflect

- **What's working?** What are users (or you) actually using and liking?
- **What's not working?** What's frustrating, missing, or broken?
- **What surprised you?** Anything the project taught you that you didn't expect?
- **What do people ask for?** (If there are users — if not, what do *you* wish it did?)

### Round 2 — Explore Directions

Based on what exists, propose 3–5 concrete directions. Ground them in evidence:
- Features that would amplify what's already working
- Pain points that need fixing
- Adjacent capabilities the architecture already supports
- Technical improvements (performance, reliability, developer experience)

For each direction, name:
- What it enables
- What it costs (effort, complexity, risk)
- Whether it builds on existing code or requires new foundations

Ask the human: "Which of these excite you? Which feel wrong? What's missing from this list?"

### Round 3 — Scope the Next Vision

- **What's the next milestone?** Not a wish list — the next meaningful state of the project.
- **What are 3–5 goals?** Priority-ordered.
- **What's explicitly NOT in this version?** (features, platforms, scale targets parked for later)
- **What new constraints or risks exist?** (scale has changed, new integrations, tech debt pressure)

### Round 4 — Sharpen

- "Here's what I think the next vision is: [summary]. Sound right?"
- Challenge anything hand-wavy or overly ambitious
- Surface contradictions with existing architecture or constraints
- Check: "Does this require breaking changes to what exists? If so, is that acceptable?"

## Ambiguity gate

- **High ambiguity** (direction unclear): Keep brainstorming. Do not proceed.
- **Medium ambiguity** (some goals vague but direction is clear): Note gaps. Proceed.
- **Low ambiguity** (clear next milestone): Proceed.

## Output

### 1. Archive the current vision

Move the current vision lock:
```bash
cp docs/vision/VISION-LOCK.md docs/vision/archive/VISION-LOCK.v{N}.md
```
Where `{N}` is the current version number.

### 2. Write new Vision Lock — `docs/vision/VISION-LOCK.md`

Follow the existing structure. Set:
- **Version**: `{N+1}.0` (major version bump)
- **Status**: `Active`
- Update all sections based on the brainstorm
- Add a changelog entry referencing the expansion

The new vision should build on what exists, not pretend the project is starting over.

### 3. Define next phase — `roadmap/phases/`

Create the next phase plan:
- Goals from the new vision, broken into implementable slices
- Acceptance criteria per goal
- Dependencies on existing code, new tech, or architecture changes
- Flag any tech debt that must be resolved first

### 4. Update Current State — `roadmap/CURRENT-STATE.md`

Set:
- **Phase Status**: `In Progress`
- **Current Phase**: Phase N+1
- **Next Action**: Begin implementation
- **Decisions Made**: Key decisions from this brainstorm (with reasoning)

### 5. Stack skills and catalog

- New technologies discussed? Create stack skills.
- New project characteristics (e.g., now has frontend, now handles payments)? Re-evaluate `.github/catalog/MANIFEST.md` and activate matching items.

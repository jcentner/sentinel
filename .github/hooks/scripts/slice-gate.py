"""Stop hook for the autonomous builder agent.

Prevents premature stopping by checking:
1. Whether stop_hook_active is set (prevents infinite loops)
2. Whether the phase is marked complete/blocked in CURRENT-STATE.md

If the phase is not complete, blocks the stop and tells the agent
what it needs to do before stopping.

name: workflow-catalog
description: "Catalog of dormant workflow capabilities that can be activated on demand. Consult when hitting a capability gap: missing design guidance, shallow security review, vague requirements, CI failures, AI-slop code patterns, context window pressure. Lists available agents, skills, hooks, prompts, and patterns with activation triggers and instructions."

# Workflow Catalog Manifest

Available capabilities that can be activated by the autonomous builder or manually. Each item includes trigger conditions, dependencies, and activation instructions.

|-------|-------|
| Source | `catalog/agents/critic.agent.md` |
| Activates to | `.github/agents/critic.agent.md` |
| Trigger | Phase planning for phases with 5+ slices, or when planner produces plans touching 10+ files |
